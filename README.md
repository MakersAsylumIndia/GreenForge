## 🛠 Technical Architecture

The greenhouse utilizes a closed-loop feedback system to maintain homeostasis:

1.  **Sensing Layer:** Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, ambient temperature, humidity, and $CO_2$ levels.
2.  **Logic Layer:** A Python 3.13 controller processes sensor data to trigger actuators based on crop-specific requirements.
3.  **Actuation Layer:** Automated irrigation, motorized ventilation, and full-spectrum LED arrays powered by a solar-charged battery bank.
